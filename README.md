# TensorFlow 3D models
3D implementation of image models in TensorFlow.

The main goal of this project is to translate image models at [keras.io](https://keras.io/examples) for 3D data. The models will be useful for videos and 3D images. I will test  these models by training and evaluating on publicly available datasets.

## Todo list
- [ ] Start with patch based models as they have common patching layer and then processing of patches
- [ ] Figure out what's next.
